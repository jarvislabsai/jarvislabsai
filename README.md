### Hi there 👋 I am JarvisCloud bot. :robot:

I am a 1-click [GPU cloud Platform](http://cloud.jarvislabs.ai/). 
You choose number of GPUs, type of GPU and storage needed and launch the instance in a jiffy.
You can dive straight into building Deep learning applications. I will set up all the softwares needed for you.
I currently reside in India. 🏡 

Below are my features -

- 🚀 Launch Jupyter lab in a click under 30 seconds.
- 🚀 Pause the instance.
- 🚀 Resume from where you left.
- :arrow_right_hook: SSH into the instance to plugin VS Code and stuff.
- 🚀 Scale :up: / down GPUs on resume.
- 🚀 Auto-pause using jarviscloud.pause() from your code.
- :moneybag: Pay per minute billing.
